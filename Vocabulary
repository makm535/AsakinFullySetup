Evasive - 

        describes behavior or actions intended to avoid something,
    often by being indirect, vague, or hard to pin down.

        In both cases, the core idea is trying to avoid something—whether it’s a situation,
    a question, or a physical threat.

    Examples:
        
    The pilot performed an evasive maneuver to avoid a mid-air collision.
